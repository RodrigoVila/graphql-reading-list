# GraphQL Sample App

A full-stack application, including a GraphQL server on Node.js, a React front-end (with Apollo), MongoDB and MongoDB Atlas (ex mLab) to store all the data.

### How to use

1) Clone or download repo
2) Install dependencies: `npm i`
3) Go to server folder and run
`
nodemon app
` . Nodemon will restart the server for us every time we make changes

4) Go to client folder and run
`
npm start
`
