# GraphQL Sample App

A full-stack application, including a GraphQL server on Node.js, a React front-end (with Apollo), MongoDB and MongoDB Atlas (ex mLab) to store all the data.

* Example is not working as I accidentally deleted the Atlas cluster ðŸ˜… and I need to create it again. I left the code just in case until I fix it :) *

### How to use

1) Clone or download repo
2) Go to server folder `cd server`
3) Install dependencies `npm i`
4) Run`nodemon app` . Nodemon will restart the server for us every time we make changes
5) Go to client folder `cd ../client`
6) Install dependencies `npm i`
7) Run`npm start`
